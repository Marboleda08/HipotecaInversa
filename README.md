# Calculadora de Hipoteca inversa

### How Does It Work?
1. Home Value: The bank or financial institution evaluates the current value of your home.
2. Owner’s Age: The older the owner, the more money they can receive.
3. Loan: Instead of making payments to the bank, the bank pays you. You can receive the money as a lump sum, in monthly payments, or as a line of credit.
4. No Monthly Payments: You don’t have to make monthly payments to the bank. The loan is repaid when you move out, sell the house, or pass away.
5. Interest and Costs: Interest and other costs accumulate over time and are added to the loan balance.

# Example
Imagine you are 70 years old and your house is worth 650,000,000 COP. With a reverse mortgage, you could receive a portion of that value in cash, say 15,046,296.30 COP without having to sell your house or make monthly payments.

# Benefits
1. Access to Cash: You get cash without selling your house.
2. Stay in Your Home: You can continue living in your home.
3. No Monthly Payments: You don’t have to worry about making monthly payments.

# Considerations
1. Debt Accumulation: The debt increases over time due to interest.
2. Reduced Inheritance: The value of the inheritance for your heirs may decrease.
3. I hope this helps! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
